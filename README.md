**üß© Strategy Pattern ‚Äî Behavioral Design Pattern**
**‚úÖ Definition**
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
In simple terms: Use Strategy when you have multiple ways of doing something, and you want to switch between them easily ‚Äî at runtime.

**üì¶ Real-World Analogy**
Imagine you have different ways to send a notification: via Email, SMS, or Slack. Each of these is a different strategy for delivering a message. Rather than using if-else or switch logic, you define each strategy separately and inject it as needed.

**üß± Structure**
NotificationStrategy (interface)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EmailNotificationStrategy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SmsNotificationStrategy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SlackNotificationStrategy

NotificationContext (selects and uses the strategy dynamically)
NotificationController (API layer that receives requests)

**üíª Implementation Summary**
1. Each strategy (EmailNotificationStrategy, etc.) implements the NotificationStrategy interface.
2. NotificationContext uses Spring's ApplicationContext to dynamically retrieve and use the desired strategy bean.
3. The controller delegates the work to NotificationContext based on the channel query parameter.

**üî• Benefits**
1. Adheres to the Open/Closed Principle ‚Äî you can add new strategies without modifying existing logic.
2. Avoids messy if-else chains.
3. Promotes cleaner, testable, and maintainable code.
4. Strategies are easily mockable in unit tests.


## üß© Factory Design Pattern

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to encapsulate object creation logic. It allows the code to delegate the instantiation of specific types to a factory class instead of using direct `new` calls.
---
### ‚úÖ Problem It Solves

- Decouples client code from concrete implementations.
- Centralizes object creation logic in one place.
- Enables easy addition of new types with minimal changes.
- Supports the Open/Closed Principle.

### üìñ Example Use Case: Document Exporter System

This project simulates an enterprise reporting system that allows exporting reports in different formats: `PDF`, `Excel`, `Word`, and `HTML`.

Each exporter implements a common interface, and the correct exporter is selected at runtime using a factory based on a request parameter.

### üèóÔ∏è Components

| Class/Interface             | Responsibility                                             |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DocumentExporter`         | Interface defining the contract for all exporters          |
| `PdfExporter`              | Concrete class to export content in PDF format             |
| `ExcelExporter`            | Concrete class to export content in Excel format           |
| `WordExporter`             | Concrete class to export content in Word format            |
| `HtmlExporter`             | Concrete class to export content in HTML format            |
| `DocumentExporterFactory`  | Contains logic to return appropriate exporter based on input |
| `DocumentExportController` | Spring REST controller to handle export requests           |

### üîÅ How It Works

1. User sends an HTTP request like `POST /export?format=pdf` with raw content.  
2. `DocumentExportController` receives the request.  
3. It asks `DocumentExporterFactory` to provide the correct `DocumentExporter` implementation.  
4. The exporter processes the content and returns the formatted result.

### üöÄ Example API Request & Response

```
POST /export?format=pdf
Content-Type: text/plain

Quarterly Report: Q2 Performance

Response:
[PDF Document]: Quarterly Report: Q2 Performance
```

### üß† When to Use Factory Pattern

```
1. When the client code needs to create objects but should not depend on their concrete classes.  
2. When object creation logic is complex or repetitive.  
3. When new object types are added frequently.
```
